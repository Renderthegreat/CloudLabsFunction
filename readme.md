### How to Use:

#### 1. Installation:

- Clone the Electro Server.js Server Program repository from [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Renderthegreat/ElectroServer).
- Install Node.js and npm if not already installed on your system.
- Type ./install on linux or type npm install in the main directory and in the nuxt-edge directory on windows.

#### 2. Configuration:

- Modify the `app.jsx` file to create your application's components and define their behavior.
- Adjust the `filter.jsx` file to implement custom request filtering or processing with ease.

#### 3. Customization:

- Add additional functionality by creating new modules or modifying existing ones.
- Integrate third-party libraries or frameworks to extend the capabilities of your server application.
- Configure server settings such as port number, logging behavior, and error handling to suit your requirements.
- Create your own plugins to share to the world with ease.

#### 4. Deployment:

- Once your application is configured and customized to your liking, deploy it to your desired hosting environment.
- Monitor server performance and usage to identify any potential issues or optimizations.

const { h } = require("preact");
const { render } = require("preact-render-to-string");
const r = render;
let clicks = 0;
let styles = `h1 {
  color: orange;
  animation: color-change 5s infinite;
}

@keyframes color-change {
  0% {
    color: orange;
  }
  10% {
    color: red;
  }
  90% {
    color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    color: orange;
  }
}`;

function main(Server, Content, Host, runtime, SSR) {
  let example = Server.create("get", "/example", async (req, res) => {
    let html = new Content("text/html");
    clicks++;
    let pluralMarker;
    if (clicks == 1) {
      pluralMarker = "";
    } else {
      pluralMarker = "s";
    }
    let data = 
      <html>
        <body>
          <div>
            <h1>
              This example page has {clicks} view{pluralMarker}.
            </h1>
          </div>
          <style>{styles}</style>
        </body>
      </html>
    

    html.contents(r(data));
    html.send(req, res);
    return { failsafe:true };
  });
  async function runner() {
    const host = await require("./host.composable.js")
    host(Host, Server, Content, runtime, SSR);
  }
  runner();
}
export { main };
```


### Nuxt.js Integration

The Electro Server.js Server Program seamlessly integrates with Nuxt.js, a powerful framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static web applications using Vue.js. By combining the features of Nuxt.js with the flexibility of the Electro Server.js Server Program, developers can create dynamic and scalable web applications with ease.

#### Installation

To get started, ensure you have both Nuxt.js and the Electro Server.js Server Program installed in your development environment. You can install Nuxt.js using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install nuxt
```

#### Integration

Once both Nuxt.js and the Electro Server.js Server Program are installed, you can integrate Nuxt.js into your server application using the `host.nuxt` method provided by the Electro Server.js Server Program.

In your `host.composable.js` file, use the following code to integrate Nuxt.js with your server:

```javascript
await host.nuxt("./nuxt-edge/api/edge.js", "/nuxt", "/");
```

This line of code instructs the Electro Server.js Server Program to serve the Nuxt.js application located at `./nuxt-edge/api/edge.js` on the route `/nuxt`. The third parameter `"/"` specifies the base URL for the Nuxt.js application.

#### Configuration

Ensure that your Nuxt.js application is configured to work with the Electro Server.js Server Program. You may need to adjust your Nuxt.js configuration to ensure compatibility with the server environment.

#### Usage

Once configured, you can access your Nuxt.js application by navigating to the specified route in your browser. The Electro Server.js Server Program will handle the routing and serve the Nuxt.js application as expected.

#### Benefits

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Nuxt.js enables server-side rendering, improving performance and SEO for your web applications.
- **Dynamic Routing**: With Nuxt.js and the Electro Server.js Server Program, you can define custom routes and handle dynamic content with ease.
- **Scalability**: The combined power of Nuxt.js and the Electro Server.js Server Program allows for scalable and maintainable web applications.



### Conclusion:

The Electro Server.js Server Program offers a powerful and flexible solution for building and deploying web applications and APIs. With its modular architecture, customizable features, and easy-to-use interface, it empowers developers to create dynamic and scalable server applications tailored to their specific needs.
