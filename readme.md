#### Example:

- Here is an example of how you can create an `app.jsx`:
  ```jsx
  const { h } = require("preact");
  const { render } = require("preact-render-to-string");
  let clicks = 0;
  let styles = `h1 {
    color: red;
  }`;

  function main(Server, Content, Host, runtime) {
    let example = Server.create("get", "/example", async (req, res) => {
      let html = new Content("text/html");
      clicks++;
      let data = (
        <html>
          <body>
            <div>
              <h1>This example page has {clicks} views.</h1>
            </div>
            <style>{styles}</style>
          </body>
        </html>
      );

      html.contents(render(data));
      html.send(req, res);
      return { failSafe: true };
    });

    async function runner() {
      let host = new Host();
      host.hostDir("get", "server", "/");
      await Server.start(80);
      await runtime.sleep(250);
      runtime.log(
        "Press (CTRL + Q) to pause. Or press (CTRL + E) to end.",
        ""
      );
    }
    runner();
  }

  module.exports.main = main;
  ```
